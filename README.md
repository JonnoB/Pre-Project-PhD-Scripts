# Pre-Project PhD Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts for code that was developed as part of my PhD. The code is smaller projects or ideas that are either stand alone or were spun out of larger projects but which don't yet require there own repo.

Some of these scripts will go on to be developed in to projects and repos in their own rights others will just be abandoned as ideas move on.

**N.B** This repo may have a more complicated branch structure than some of my other repos.
